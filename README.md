Zapping-Rachel-Phase-1-DEF-CON-22
=================================

Phase 1 challenged contestants to build a honeypot that identifies inaccurate information in incoming calls, such as spoofed caller IDs, or determines which calls are likely robocalls. Jonâ€™s honeypot uses a combination of an audio captcha filter, call detail analysis, and recording and transcription analysis to determine, on a sliding scale, the likelihood that an incoming call was a robocall.

Judges scored submissions based on functionality and accuracy, as well as innovation and creativity. To be eligible for prizes, contestants had to satisfy the eligibility requirements specified in the Official Rules. Complete rules and judging criteria are available on the contest webpage. The winning solutions include open-source code and are designed to assist in the battle against robocallers, and the FTC will post additional information about the submissions online in the coming weeks.
